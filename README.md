Source code for the Pragmatic Unit Testing
=====================

This source code is inspired by [github.com/vkhorikov/AutoBuyer][L0], which is the source code for 
the [Building a Pragmatic Unit Test Suite Pluralsight course][L1]. It was converted to a Spring Boot 
app to serve as a reference point for java developers.

There are two versions of the code base: the [old version][L2] that doesn't comply with the unit 
testing guidelines described in the course and the [new one][L3] which adheres to those guidelines.
